What is Twitter Scraping?

Scraping is a technique to get information from Social Network sites. Scraping Twitter can yield many insights into sentiments, opinions and social media trends. Analysing tweets, shares, likes, URLs and interests is a powerful way to derive insight into public conversations. It is legal to scrape Twitter or any other SNS(Social Networking Sites) to extract publicly available information, but you should be aware that the data extracted might contain personal data.
